# PyPI workflows

Load for pip, uv, Twine, Python dependency, wheel, or source-distribution work.

## Install

Use a private repository once:

```bash
rvs pip --rvs-target platform/packages install internal-sdk
rvs uv --rvs-target platform/packages sync
```

Use an official private mirror once:

```bash
rvs pip --rvs-target mirror:pypiorg install requests
```

Ravenstash must be the primary index for a selected Ravenstash resolution
workflow. Do not recommend pip `--extra-index-url`; dependency-confusion rules
can allow the unintended index to win. Use a repository upstream attachment or
an explicit mirror target instead.

## Publish

Publishing requires a private PyPI repository, never a mirror:

```bash
rvs twine --rvs-target platform/releases upload dist/*
rvs uv --rvs-target platform/releases publish
```

Inspect the distribution files and exact repository before publishing. A
publish creates durable remote state and is not a preparatory step that may be
invented to satisfy another request.

## Persistent configuration

`rvs art endpoint --format pypi --access read|publish` prints an address.
`rvs art native config pip` and `rvs art native config twine` print instructions
without minting credentials or changing files. Pip has fixed read intent and
Twine fixed publish intent; neither accepts `--access`. Executing the printed
setup or editing native configuration requires the user's corresponding intent.
