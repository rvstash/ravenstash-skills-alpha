# Repositories and private mirrors

Load for repository discovery or creation, package lifecycle work, private-mirror
discovery or creation, or questions about upstream attachment.

## Private repositories

Inspect before changing:

```bash
rvs art repo list
rvs art repo list --format pypi
rvs art repo show platform/packages
rvs art repo upstream list platform/packages pypi
```

Creation requires an explicit name and one or more formats:

```bash
rvs art repo create platform/packages --format pypi,npm
rvs art repo create platform/packages --format pypi --format npm
```

A bare name creates the repository in the acting account's default namespace.
A logical repository can contain several formats. Confirm all intended formats
rather than creating another same-named repository to compensate for a missing
lane.

## Web-app-only operations

`rvs` does not rename or delete repositories, add, change, or remove upstreams,
change a private mirror's package-age policy, delete a private mirror, or delete
a whole package. Route these requests to the Ravenstash web app after resolving
the exact account and repository or mirror; do not invent an `rvs` command or a
direct API call. Do not infer retention or recovery guarantees; point to current
public documentation.

## Private mirrors

Private mirrors are read-only and support only PyPI, npm, and Maven. Each is
backed by an official or customer-defined remote cache, and their targets remain
distinct:

```bash
rvs art mirror list
rvs art mirror show rc_...
rvs art mirror create pypiorg --select
rvs art mirror select pypiorg
rvs art mirror select --custom company-python
```

Use a mirror once without changing the saved target:

```bash
rvs pip --rvs-target mirror:pypiorg install requests
rvs pip --rvs-target custom-mirror:company-python install internal-sdk
```

Create custom mirrors in the web app. The CLI can list, show, and select
existing custom mirrors; it cannot create, change, or delete them.

## Upstream attachment

A repository can use a mirror's backing remote cache as an upstream. Inspect the
configured sources with `rvs art repo upstream list`; attach, reorder, or
detach them in the web app. The repository's own packages are checked first,
and configured upstream positions are `1` through `4`. An attachment copies the
cache's age setting at creation and is then managed independently. A later
mirror age change must not be described as automatically changing existing
attachments.

## Package lifecycle

Package commands act on the private repository chosen with `rvs art select`
unless `--target` is passed; a selected mirror is rejected. `--format` is
required only when that repository has more than one of PyPI, npm, and Maven;
passing it for a single-format repository is harmless and keeps the intended
format explicit:

```bash
rvs art package list --target platform/packages --format pypi
rvs art package show requests --target platform/packages --format pypi
rvs art package show requests --target platform/packages --format pypi --version 2.32.3
rvs art package yank requests 2.32.3 --target platform/packages --reason "broken wheel"
rvs art package deprecate left-pad 1.0.0 --target platform/packages --message "Use 1.0.1"
rvs art package delete-version requests 2.32.3 --target platform/packages --format pypi
```

`package show` prints the summary and the newest 50 versions; use `--limit N`
(1-100), `--all-versions`, or `--version VERSION` for one version with its files
and digests. With root `--json` it prints one document with `package`,
`versions`, and `versions_next_cursor`.

Yank and unyank always apply to PyPI; deprecate and undeprecate always apply to
npm. These commands take no `--format`. Maven has no corresponding lifecycle
operation.

Yank, deprecate, and delete-version change remote package state. Confirm exact
package, version, repository, format, and account before invoking them. Do not
add `--yes` unless the exact deletion is already authorized.
