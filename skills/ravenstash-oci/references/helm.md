# Helm OCI workflows

Use the selected repository for Helm chart work when the installed CLI supports
shorthand. For an older CLI, use full `oci://` references from `rvs oci-reference`.
Helm requires the Helm kind even when a repository also supports Container.

## Read and render

```bash
rvs art select platform/deployment-charts
rvs helm show chart charts/api --version 1.2.3
rvs helm pull charts/api --version 1.2.3
rvs helm template preview charts/api --version 1.2.3
```

Selection changes saved metadata; use `--rvs-target` for an authorized one-shot
target without changing selection. Short paths are private, including names
matching local directories or public aliases such as `bitnami/nginx`. Use explicit
local paths (`./api`) for local charts and plain Helm for configured public
aliases. Full OCI/HTTP URLs and explicit `--repo` keep their native meaning.
No private miss falls back publicly.

## Publish or deploy

Within the user's authorized publication scope:

```bash
rvs helm push api-1.2.3.tgz
rvs helm push api-1.2.3.tgz team/backend
```

The first destination is the selected repository root; the second adds a
subdirectory. Helm appends the chart metadata name and version. Do not include
them in the push destination. Verify the resulting reference and digest.

Install and upgrade also accept short chart operands. Release names remain
unchanged; deploying a release is a separate user action from reading or
publishing a chart. Preserve the intended Kubernetes context and namespace.

Keep full repository URLs in `Chart.yaml`. One invocation authorizes one private
Ravenstash repository, while public dependencies keep their own URLs and existing
credentials. Remote caches are not supported for Helm repositories.
