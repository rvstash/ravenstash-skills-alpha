description: Route Ravenstash product requests to the correct supported surface and apply Ravenstash product vocabulary, availability boundaries, and safe operating rules. Use when a user asks about Ravenstash, Ravenstash Artifacts, repositories, private mirrors, rvs, PyPI, npm, Maven, Container, Helm, or which Ravenstash workflow to use.

# Ravenstash

Use this skill to orient the request, then use the most specific Ravenstash
workflow available. Do not use it as a substitute for current public
documentation or installed CLI help.

## Choose the surface

- Use `ravenstash-cli` for installation, updates, authentication, local
  profiles, acting-account selection, artifact-target context, local runtimes, or CLI
  troubleshooting.
- Use `ravenstash-packages` for private PyPI, npm, or Maven repositories,
  private mirrors, package publishing, installs, package lifecycle operations,
  and package automation.
- Use `ravenstash-oci` for Container or Helm repositories and Docker, Helm, or
  ORAS workflows.
- Use the Ravenstash web application for account security settings,
  organization membership, passkeys, automation-token creation, and workflows
  not exposed by `rvs`.

Read [references/product-model.md](references/product-model.md) when the request
depends on repository kinds, target types, terminology, or current product
availability.

## Source priority

1. Treat installed `rvs` help as authoritative for the commands that binary
   supports: run `rvs --version` and `rvs <group> --help` before inventing a
   command or option.
2. Use <https://docs.ravenstash.com/> for current product procedures and
   availability. The machine-readable entrypoint is
   <https://docs.ravenstash.com/llms.txt>.
3. Use <https://ravenstash.com/llms-full.txt> for current high-level product
   facts and boundaries.
4. If these sources disagree, report the version or documentation mismatch and
   do not guess.

## Operating boundaries

- Use `rvs` or the documented browser workflow for Ravenstash operations. Do
  not construct direct Ravenstash API calls.
- A skill provides procedure, not authorization. Preserve the user's requested
  scope and stop before an unrequested create, update, publish, yank, delete,
  target switch, or persistent configuration change.
- Never request, print, copy, or persist a Ravenstash access token. Interactive
  login uses the browser-backed device flow; automation receives `RVS_TOKEN`
  from the user's secret store.
- Resolve the local profile, acting account, target, and registry kind before
  any operation that could affect remote state. Never substitute a same-named
  object from another account or namespace.
- Do not imply that a roadmap product or placeholder CLI group is usable. The
  coordinated command surface uses `rvs art repo`; top-level `rvs repo`,
  `rvs artifacts`, and `rvs ci` are absent.
- Do not invent billing, quota, retention, anonymous access, or package-security
  behavior. Refer volatile policy questions to current public documentation.

## Completion

Report the surface used, the resolved account and target when relevant, the
observable result, and any state intentionally changed. Do not expose tokens or
secret-bearing output.
